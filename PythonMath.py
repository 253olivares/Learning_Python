# Python Math

# Python has a set of built in math functions, including an extensive math module that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers

# Built-in Math Functions

# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest and highest value in a iterable

x = min(1,10,25)

y = max(5,10,25)

print(x)
print(y)

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a specified number:

x = abs(-7.25)
print(x)

# The pow(x,y) function returns the value of x to the power of y

x = pow(4,3)
print(x)

# The math module
# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

# To use it, you must import the math module:

import math

# When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module

# The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

import math
x = math.sqrt(64)

print(x)

# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

import math
x = math.ceil(1.4)
x = math.floor(1.4)

print(x)
print(y)

# The math.pi constant, returns the values of PI (3.14...)

import math

x = math.pi

print(x)
