# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# Comments can be used to explain python code

# Any time # is utilize python will ignore it as a comment

# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

# comments can be added after code and it will only read the code and ignore the rest after #
print("Hello, World!") # This is a comment

# The following code will not run 
# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

# Python does not have a syntax for multiline comments like other langauges
# The most you can do is add # ever new line

# What can be used is a multiline string as this will ignore string literals not assinged
# This is not its intended used but can be used as such
